# Crew Resource Management

## 🚨 Hazardous Attitudes

😡  **Anti-authority**:  "Don't tell me what to do!"
(This attitude can happen even without traditional authority figures)

😱  **Impulsivity**:  "We gotta do something now!!"

☺️  **Invulnerability**:  "Tragedy is something you hear about on the news, it couldn't happen to me"

🎖️  **Overconfidence**:  "I can do it! I can handle anything!"

😞  **Resignation**:  "There's no use even trying"

⌚  **Pressing**:  "Let's hurry this up, I want to go home and have dinner"

😎  **Airshow Syndrome**:  "Hold my beer and watch this!"


## 💩 Loss of Situational Awareness

🤔  **Ambiguity**:  Your understanding of the situation is full of open questions

🙂‍↔️  **Distraction**:  Focus is being drawn to less important things, perhaps without anyone noticing

🧐  **Fixation**:  One item absolutely dominates thought and conversation

🫨  **Overload**:  New information and events are piling on faster than anyone can respond

😌  **Complacency**:  Nothing is apparently going wrong, but close attention is not being paid and standards are being relaxed

🙃  **Improper Procedure**:  Things are done in unusual ways without documentation or justification

😐  **Unresolved Discrepancy**:  A backlog of issues or conflicts that have not been attended to

😴  **Nobody flying the plane**:  There is nobody managing moment to moment operations, possibly because nobody is sure who is meant to be doing so.


## 📣 Mistakes when Speaking or Writing

🤪  **Failure to establish context**: "Pull that line" could mean multiple things

😗  **Providing biased information** or **intentionally withholding information**, such as saying "There's enough fuel left", rather than giving a specific amount

🤫 **Being unwilling to repeat or clarify** if the listener did not understand

😠  **Aggressive, disrespectful, or malicious communication**, sprinkling in personal insults, using disrespectful or disinterested body language.


## 🌽 Mistakes when Listening

🥱  **Making your mind up before listening**: "Anything this person says is obviously trash"

🤠  **Poor preparation**: Listening is a conscious activity that may involve taking notes, or intentionally pausing distractions

🙄  **Ignoring Nonverbal Signals**

😊 **Not asking for clarification**: often caused by unwillingness to admit you don't already know something

🤬  **Creating a climate of fear** by always responding negatively, verbally or otherwise.


## Error Management

### 🏋  Maintain Proficiency

Failure to maintain proficiency removes a critical layer of redundancy, even though things may appear "safe enough" due to luck or technology.


### 📣  Speak Up!

Don't ignore unsafe conditions or allow yourself to be pushed into dangerous situations.

### ✅  Follow Protocol

> Slow is Smooth and Smooth is Fast

Even small changes may have unknown consequences, especially in the face of unknown external events, and ignoring the rules when you think they don't matter can make it more likely that you will forget something when they do.

### 🦗  Minimize Distraction

Just "Being careful" is a overused cliche. Nobody is perfectly reliable or capable.

What you can  do is remove distractions, to maximize the ability you do have. Do not leave distractions and hazards around, and plan critical tasks for times when you are well rested, not dehydrated, hungry, angry, or otherwise impaired.

### 🤝  Plan Ahead

> Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance

Treat potential problems seriously even if you do not know for certain they will occur, do as much as possible ahead of time under controlled conditions.

### 👁  Maintain Situational Awareness

Especially with hands-off and automated processes, it is very easy to become complacent.  Things that are hard to observe, or which cannot be inspected once finished can also be sources of trouble. Who hasn't wondered if they left the oven on?

### 🧑‍🏭️  Effectively use Resources

Do not show off by doing things "the hard way".  Use the appropriate tools and protective equipment(Even if you have to stop and get them!), get a second pair of eyes on important tasks, and set timers for things that may be forgotten.

### 🛡 Multiple Layers of Safety

> Two is one, one is none, and three is a good start

Avoid relying on any one device or method whenever possible. Avoid situations where one mistake
will cause major problems, even if you think "nobody would ever make that mistake".  

Even the experts can press the wrong button or misidentify a mushroom, and there are many shop teachers who have lost a finger.

Backup plans that are very different from the primary are less likely to be affected by the same causes of failure at the same time.
